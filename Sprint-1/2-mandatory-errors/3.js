// The last4Digits variable should store the last 4 digits of cardNumber
// However, the code isn't working
// Before running the code, make and explain a prediction about why the code won't work
// Then run the code and see what error it gives.
// Consider: Why does it give this error? Is this what I predicted? If not, what's different?
// Then try updating the expression last4Digits is assigned to, in order to get the correct value

//my answer:
//slice() only works for string or Array,cardNumber is number so i predict that the computer will give TypeError. When i 
//run this Code, my prediction is right. In order to fix it, first cast to string first:

const cardNumber=4533787178994213;

//then convert to string
const last4Digits = cardNumber.toString().slice(-4);
console.log(last4Digits);

// or i can put quotes on cardNumber which will be string
const cardNumber1 ="4533787178994213"
const last4Digits1 = cardNumber1.slice(-4);
console.log(last4Digits1)
