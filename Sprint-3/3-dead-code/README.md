# Refactoring Dead Code

Here are two example of code that has not been built efficiently. Both files have dead code in them. It's your job to go back through this existing code, identify the dead code, and remove it so the code is ready for production.

## Instructions

1. Work through each `exercise` file inside this directory.
2. Delete the dead code.
3. Commit your changes and make a PR when done.
